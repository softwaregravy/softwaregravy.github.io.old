Saw a link to [this] (http://javahungry.blogspot.com/2013/09/core-java-coding-programming-questions-answers-technical-interview-java.html) set of 'interview' questions linked from [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1ne1a8/goldman_sachs_interview_please_explain_the_logic/). 
Supposedly someone was asked these during an interview at Goldman Sachs.

I received a similar interview once when I was an undergrad. I walked into a room, introduced myself to the gentleman sitting there, and then was quizzed with 25 questions about Java. Now, given I was applying for an internship, the questions were probably easier than this (I don't recall).
However, the interview format was really just a quiz of 25 questions. 

I've probably done on the order of 30-50 interviews over my career. (I did a lot of interviews during Waterloo's co-op program. I didn't get a tonne of job offers, so I got a lot of practice.) This interview is one of my clearest memories of interviewing, and not for good reasons.
It's one of those points I wish I could got back and change -- years later I keep replaying how else I might have handled the situation.

Regardless of how I should have handled it in the past, I know how I would handle something like this today: I would leave. That's it. I'd thank the interviewer for his or her time, say the position doesn't look like a good fit, and leave. 

IMHO, quiz-style interviews demonstrate either a lack of respect or lack of empathy for the interviewer and also a lack of interviewing skill on the part of the interviewer. Either way, it tells me this isn't a place I'd like to work.
